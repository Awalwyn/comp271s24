# Assignment 4

As with *every assignment* in this course, you cannot import anything to your code. For this assignment you cannot use `java.util.ArrayList`. Furthermore, you cannot use any `System` function except for `System.out` print statements where and when needed. Finally, your code should not use any `for`-loops.

Your code must be compliant with the Programmers Pact, as much as possible.

You can test your work by running `SimpleTesting.main`.

## Search for a station

Write a method called `contains` that returns true if a station with a specified name exists in a `TrainLine` object and false otherwise.

## Design (specify) the string representation of `TrainLine`

If you attempt to print a `TrainLine` object, the result will be something like<br/>
```
TrainLine@ad4fe7
```
<br/>
Propose a better way to represent a `TrainLine` object. Your proposal should be specific enough that an intermediate developer could execute it. Focus on what would you like the representative string to look like.
